## AI Agent

#### Strategies
- ReAct : Reasoning + Acting to improve decision making.
- CoT: Chain of Thought Prompting to problem into steps.
- Few-shot / Zero-shot learning: Low training data	
- Self-Reflective Prompting wher AI Critiques response iteratively.
- Autonomous Agent: AutoGPT & BabyAGI breakdoen tasks
- Rule-based + ML hybrid: Predictable queries	
- Self-learning AI / Clustering: New intents evolve	
- Context-aware intent detection: Multi-turn dialogues	
- Multi-intent detection: Users ask for multiple things	
- Reinforcement Learning: AI needs feedback improvement
